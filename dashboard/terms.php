                    <p>Identifiable information such as phone number, postal address, email address, and any other information may be requested from you. The need for identifiable information may arise when we need to identify you and directly get in contact with you.</p><br><br><br>


                    <h4 class="blu">COOKIES</h4>
                    <p>Cookies are unique anonymous identifiers that contain a small amount of data. Cookies are usually sent from a website to a browser, and the data is usually stored on a computer's hard drive.</p>
                    <p>It is possible for a service user to disable the functionality of cookies by restricting a web browser. Notwithstanding, enabling cookies on a browser would make it possible for a user to enjoy all the services that we provide.</p><br><br><br>

                    <h4 class="blu">SERVICE PROVIDERS</h4>
                    <p>The services of third party companies may be employed when necessary. The services of third-party companies may be required to enhance the result that we deliver. Third-party services may include the analysis of data, providing service on our behalf, an analysis of the performance of our service, and any other assistance that we may need. More so, third-party companies would adhere to our privacy policy, so the use of your personal information would be limited to the purpose of the collaboration.</p><br><br><br>

                    <h4 class="blu">COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS</h4>
                    <p>We understand that the authorities may request for your personal information when needed to handle legal issues, so we would abide by the law in providing your personal information to law enforcement agents as required by law. We value the integrity of our service, and always comply with the law when the situation is justifiable.</p><br><br><br>

                    <h4 class="blu">SECURITY</h4>
                    <p>Securing your personal information is vital to us because we need it to be a favorable option for our service users.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding, we would admit to the fact that the use of the internet and other channels of sharing information online may not guarantee 100% security.</p>
                    <p>So, we do not guarantee absolute security to all the information that we possess, but we do our best in utilizing commercial means of safeguarding your personal information and ensuring that it does not get into the wrong hands.</p><br><br><br>

                    <h4 class="blu">INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER</h4>
                    <p>The information that you give to us may be sent to computers that are located far away from your geographical area. Such information may be transferred to computers that are in a different state or country. Such information transfer may see your information placed in a region that operates on a different law that is beyond your jurisdiction.</p><br>
                    <p>It is also important to note that we can transfer your personal information to a different region other than the location where you provided the information, and also, decide on the exact place where your information is processed or handled. By submitting your personal information to us, you consent to our ability to transfer your personal information to the location where we intend handling the processing.</p><br><br><br>

                    <h4 class="blu">THIRD PARTY LINKS</h4>
                    <p>By visiting our website, you may find the links to other third-party websites, so it should be noted that the information you receive or submit to such sites is strictly at your own risk.

                    <h4 class="blu">THE PRIVACY OF CHILDREN</h4>
                    <p>We do not deal with children, so anyone under the age of 12 is not expected to send personal information to us. In a situation where a child sends personal information to us, it is expected that the guardian or parent of that child make early contact with us as this would enable us to remove from our database, the personal information of the child.</p><br><br><br>

                    <h4 class="blu">PRIVACY POLICY CHANGE</h4>
                    <p>We reserve the right to effect changes to our privacy policy without seeking your consent.

                    <p>You also have the liberty to demand the deletion or cancellation of all your personal information, unless the law enforces the preservation of such information.</p><br><br>
